# LazyList

Have you ever found yourself in a situation, where you used a generator, but then realized, that you sometimes need an element from further in the future? Or specific past element? This very specific problem is no more, thank to LazyList! (Wow!)

## What does it do?
It's a list, that gets initialied using an iterable. The list uses the iterable to generate when new elements are accessed.
